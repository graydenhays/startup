# Notes
## HTTPS
- secure hypertext transport protocol
- encrypted using tls protocol
- Request syntax
    - `<verb> <url path, parameters, anchor> <version>
      [<header key: value>]*
      [
      
        <body>
      ]`
- Request types
    - GET --> obtaining data
    - POST --> creating something new with a unique ID
    - PUT --> updating something with the provided unique ID
    - DELETE --> deleting something with the provided unique ID
    - OPTIONS --> gets limited data about something; does not return the           actual item
- Status codes
    - 100s --> providing info
    - 200s --> indicating success
    - 300s --> redirecting to another location, or that a cached item is still valid
    - 400s --> errors on the client side, invalid request
    - 500s --> errors on the server side, valid request but unable to process
- Response syntax
    - `<version> <status code> <status string>
      [<header key: value>]*
      [
      
        <body>
      ]`
- Header types
    - Authorization --> authorizes the user
    - Accept --> the format accepted by the client
    - Content-Type --> the format of the sent content; represented by MIME types
        - text/plain --> human readable with no binary data; used for text files
        - application/octet-stream --> used with unknown file types; processed with extra caution
        - ^^defaults. there are many others for audio, images, json, etc.
    - Cookie --> Key value pairs that are generated by the server and stored on the client.
    - Host --> The domain name of the server. This is required in all requests.
    - Origin --> Identifies the origin that caused the request. A host may only allow requests from specific origins.
    - Access-Control-Allow-Origin --> Server response of what origins can make a request. This may include a wildcard.
    - Content-Length --> The number of bytes contained in the response.
    - Cache-Control --> Tells the client how it can cache the response.
    - User-Agent --> The client application making the request.
- Cookies
    - help to keep track of HTTP state --> HTTP doesn't know previous or future requests
    - ex: language preference or authentication credentials
    - Can also use cookies to track, and share, everything that a user does
    - Nothing inherently evil about cookies; can be used as a means to violate a user's privacy or inappropriately monetize their data.
    - http-only --> can't be accessed by javascript, only the server
    - secure --> only sent with an encrypted request over https
    - same site --> controls whether/when cookies are sent with cross-site requests

- Acronyms
  JSX - javascript xml
  JS - javascript
  AWS - amazon web service
  NPM - node package manager
  NVM - node version manager
- Fetch
    - `fetch(url)
       .then(r => r.text())
       .then(text => console.log(text))`
    - `const r = await fetch('https://quote.cs260.click/')
        const j = await r.json()
        console.log(j.content)`

## HTML
- block element --> 'a distinct block in the flow of the content structure'
- inline element --> 'meant to be inline with the content flow of a block element' -> they don't disrupt the flow of a block element's content
- relative path --> 'references a file that is served fro mthe same location as the HTML page rendering the element'
## Javascript
### DOM: Document Object Model
- "an object representation of the HTML elements that the browser uses to render the display. The browser also exposes the DOM to external code so that you can write programs that dynamically manipulate the HTML." --> accessed through the keyword 'document'
  - "The DOM supports the ability to insert, modify, or delete the elements in the DOM. To create a new element you first create the element on the DOM document. You then insert the new element into the DOM tree by appending it to an existing element in the tree."
  - "The DOM also allows you to inject entire blocks of HTML into an element... However, directly injecting HTML as a block of text is a common attack vector for hackers. If an untrusted party can inject JavaScript anywhere in your application then that JavaScript can represent itself as the current user of the application. The attacker can then make requests for sensitive data, monitor activity, and steal credentials."
### Promises
- Long running blocks of code should be done with Promises
- allows the main rendering thread to continue while some action is executed in the background
- asynchronous: the promis constructor may return before the promise executor runs
- promise states
    - pending
    - fulfilled
    - rejected
- 'then' is called if the promise is fulfilled
- 'catch' is called if the promise is rejected
- 'finally' is always called after all the processing is completed
Example:
````
const coinToss = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    if (Math.random() > 0.1) {
      resolve(Math.random() > 0.5 ? 'heads' : 'tails');
    } else {
      reject('fell off table');
    }
  }, 10000);
});
coinToss
  .then((result) => console.log(`Coin toss result: ${result}`))
  .catch((err) => console.log(`Error: ${err}`))
  .finally(() => console.log('Toss completed'));
````
- Using await
    - "The ***async*** keyword declares that a function returns a promise. The ***await** keyword wraps a call to the async function, blocks execution until the promise has resolved, and then returns the result of the promise."
````
try {
  const result = await coinToss();
  console.log(`Toss result ${result}`);
} catch (err) {
  console.error(`Error: ${err}`);
} finally {
  console.log(`Toss completed`);
}
````
## Vite
- a CLI (command line interface) that initially sets up the web application
- configures the toolchain parameters and quickly sets up a default application
- uses .jsx files instead of .js for JSX files

## React
- Hooks
    - state --> let component 'remember' various information
    - Context --> lets a component receive information from distant parents without passing it as props
    - Refs --> let a component hold some information that isn’t used for rendering, like a DOM node or a timeout ID. Unlike with state, updating a ref does not re-render your component. Refs are an “escape hatch” from the React paradigm. They are useful when you need to work with non-React systems, such as the built-in browser APIs
    - Effects --> let a component connect to and synchronize with external systems. This includes dealing with network, browser DOM, animations, widgets written using a different UI library, and other non-React code.
    - Performance --> A common way to optimize re-rendering performance is to skip unnecessary work
Package.json --> configures project: dependencies, metadata, and enabling npm to manage the project
fetch --> makes a javascript api request
node.js --> allows javascript to be run on a server
pm2 --> process manager for node
vite --> gives a fast, optimized startup for production environments
